## Welcome to My Engineering Blog

In the fast-paced world of Cloud Computing and DevOps, theory often diverges from reality. This space is dedicated to bridging that gap.

I am **Gustavo de Oliveira Ferreira**, a Cloud & DevOps Engineer with a passion for designing secure, scalable, and resilient systems. Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of working on mission-critical projects for major organizations in the financial and healthcare sectors.

### Why This Blog?

The goal of this platform is simple: **to share "war stories" and architectural patterns forged in the fires of real-world enterprise environments.**

You won't find basic "Hello World" tutorials here. Instead, expect deep dives into:

*   **Enterprise-Grade Kubernetes:** Orchestration at scale with OpenShift and AKS.
*   **Security & Compliance:** Practical implementation of SBOM, HIPAA, and FedRAMP controls.
*   **Infrastructure as Code:** Advanced Terraform patterns and automation strategies.
*   **Multi-Cloud Architectures:** Navigating the complexities of AWS and Azure ecosystems.

### A Commitment to Open Knowledge

I believe that engineering is a collaborative discipline. By sharing these insights, I hope to contribute to the community and help fellow engineers navigate the complexities of modern cloud architecture.

Stay tuned for technical deep dives, architectural decision records, and practical guides.

Let's build the future, one pipeline at a time.
